Every step in your solution must be logically sound and clearly explained. A correct final answer derived from flawed or incomplete reasoning is considered a failure.\n*   **Honesty About Completeness:** If you cannot find a complete solution, you must **not** guess or create a solution that appears correct but contains hidden flaws or justification gaps. Instead, you should present only significant partial results that you can rigorously prove. A partial result is considered significant if it represents a substantial advancement toward a full solution. Examples include:\n    *   Proving a key lemma.\n    *   Fully resolving one or more cases within a logically sound case-based proof.\n    *   Establishing a critical property of the mathematical objects in the problem.\n    *   For an optimization problem, proving an upper or lower bound without proving that this bound is achievable.\n*   **Use TeX for All Mathematics:** All mathematical variables, expressions, and relations must be enclosed in TeX delimiters (e.g., `Let $n$ be an integer.`).\n\n### Output Format ###\n\nYour response MUST be structured into the following sections, in this exact order.\n\n**1. Summary**\n\nProvide a concise overview of your findings. This section must contain two parts:\n\n*   **a. Verdict:** State clearly whether you have found a complete solution or a partial solution.\n    *   **For a complete solution:** State the final answer, e.g., \"I have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is...\"\n    *   **For a partial solution:** State the main rigorous conclusion(s) you were able to prove, e.g., \"I have not found a complete solution, but I have rigorously proven that...\"\n*   **b. Method Sketch:** Present a high-level, conceptual outline of your solution. This sketch should allow an expert to understand the logical flow of your argument without reading the full detail. It should include:\n    *   A narrative of your overall strategy.\n    *   The full and precise mathematical statements of any key lemmas or major intermediate results.\n    *   If applicable, describe any key constructions or case splits that form the backbone of your argument.\n\n**2. Detailed Solution**\n\nPresent the full, step-by-step mathematical proof. Each step must be logically justified and clearly explained. The level of detail should be sufficient for an expert to verify the correctness of your reasoning without needing to fill in any gaps. This section must contain ONLY the complete, rigorous proof, free of any internal commentary, alternative approaches, or failed attempts.\n\n### Self-Correction Instruction ###\n\nBefore finalizing your output, carefully review your \"Method Sketch\" and \"Detailed Solution\" to ensure they are clean, rigorous, and strictly adhere to all instructions provided above. Verify that every statement contributes directly to the final, coherent mathematical argument.\n\n"

"### Summary ###\n\n**a. Verdict**\n\nI have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is that there is only one such prime number.\n\n**b. Method Sketch**\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows:\n1.  Let the given expression be denoted by $E$. The expression is $E = \\frac{2q^2}{1 + 2 + \\dots + q}$.\n2.  The denominator is the sum of the first $q$ positive integers, which has a well-known formula: $1 + 2 + \\dots + q = \\frac{q(q+1)}{2}$.\n3.  Substitute this formula into the expression for $E$ and simplify. This reduces the condition to finding prime numbers $q$ for which $\\frac{4q}{q+1}$ is an integer.\n4.  The expression $\\frac{4q}{q+1}$ is rewritten using algebraic manipulation as $4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$.\n5.  For $E = 4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$ to be an integer, $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ must be an integer. This means $q+1$ must be a divisor of $4$.\n6.  Since $q$ is a prime number, we know $q \\ge 2$, which implies $q+1 \\ge 3$.\n7.  By finding the divisors of 4 that are greater than or equal to 3, we determine the only possible value for $q+1$, which in turn gives the only possible value for $q$.\n8.  Finally, we verify that this value of $q$ is indeed a prime number, confirming it as the unique solution.\n\n### Detailed Solution ###\n\nLet the given expression be $E$. The problem asks for the number of prime numbers $q$ for which $E$ is an integer, where\n$$E = \\frac{2q^2}{1 + 2 + \\dots + q}$$\n\nThe denominator is the sum of the first $q$ positive integers. The formula for this sum is:\n$$1 + 2 + \\dots + q = \\frac{q(q+1)}{2}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $E$, we get:\n$$E = \\frac{2q^2}{\\frac{q(q+1)}{2}}$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$E = \\frac{2q^2 \\cdot 2}{q(q+1)} = \\frac{4q^2}{q(q+1)}$$\n\nSince $q$ is a prime number, $q \\ge 2$, so $q \\neq 0$. We can safely divide the numerator and the denominator by $q$:\n$$E = \\frac{4q}{q+1}$$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the number of prime numbers $q$ for which $\\frac{4q}{q+1}$ is an integer.\n\nWe can perform an algebraic manipulation on the expression for $E$:\n$$E = \\frac{4q}{q+1} = \\frac{4(q+1) - 4}{q+1} = \\frac{4(q+1)}{q+1} - \\frac{4}{q+1} = 4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$$\n\nFor $E$ to be an integer, $4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$ must be an integer. Since $4$ is an integer, this condition holds if and only if $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ is an integer.\n\nFor $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ to be an integer, the denominator $q+1$ must be a divisor of the numerator $4$.\nThe divisors of $4$ are $1, 2, 4$. Since $q$ is a prime number, $q$ is a positive integer, so $q+1$ must be a positive divisor of $4$.\n\nThe prime numbers are $2, 3, 5, 7, \\dots$. The smallest prime number is $q=2$.\nTherefore, we have the constraint $q \\ge 2$, which implies $q+1 \\ge 3$.\n\nWe must find the divisors of $4$ that are also greater than or equal to $3$.\nThe positive divisors of $4$ are $\\{1, 2, 4\\}$.\nComparing this set with the condition $q+1 \\ge 3$, the only possible value for $q+1$ is $4$.\n\nSetting $q+1 = 4$, we find:\n$$q = 4 - 1 = 3$$\n\nWe must check if this value of $q$ is a prime number. The number $3$ is a prime number.\nThus, $q=3$ is the only prime number that satisfies the given condition.\n\nTo verify, if $q=3$, the original expression is:\n$$\\frac{2(3^2)}{1+2+3} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 9}{6} = \\frac{18}{6} = 3$$\nSince $3$ is an integer, our solution is correct.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of such prime numbers $q$. Since we have found only one such prime, $q=3$, the answer is 1."

We can perform an algebraic manipulation on the expression for $E$:\n$$E = \\frac{4q}{q+1} = \\frac{4(q+1) - 4}{q+1} = \\frac{4(q+1)}{q+1} - \\frac{4}{q+1} = 4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$$\n\nFor $E$ to be an integer, the expression $4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$ must be an integer.

The set of all integer divisors of $4$ is $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$.\n\nWe now use the property that $q$ is a prime number. By definition, a prime number is an integer greater than $1$. The smallest prime number is $2$. Thus, we have the constraint $q \\ge 2$.\nThis constraint on $q$ implies a constraint on $q+1$:\n$$q \\ge 2 \\implies q+1 \\ge 3$$\n\nWe must find which of the integer divisors of $4$ satisfy the condition $q+1 \\ge 3$. Let's check the set of divisors $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$:\n*   $-4 < 3$\n*   $-2 < 3$\n*   $-1 < 3$\n*   $1 < 3$\n*   $2 < 3$\n*   $4 \\ge 3$\n\nThe only value in the set of divisors of $4$ that is greater than or equal to $3$ is $4$.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$$q+1 = 4$$\nSolving for $q$, we find:\n$$q = 3$$\n\nWe must verify that this value of $q$ is a prime number. The number $3$ is indeed a prime number.

Your primary task is to rigorously verify the provided mathematical solution. A solution is to be judged correct **only if every step is rigorously justified.** A solution that arrives at a correct final answer through flawed reasoning, educated guesses, or with gaps in its arguments must be flagged as incorrect or incomplete.\n\n### Instructions ###\n\n**1. Core Instructions**\n*   Your sole task is to find and report all issues in the provided solution. You must act as a **verifier**, NOT a solver. **Do NOT attempt to correct the errors or fill the gaps you find.**\n*   You must perform a **step-by-step** check of the entire solution. This analysis will be presented in a **Detailed Verification Log**, where you justify your assessment of each step: for correct steps, a brief justification suffices; for steps with errors or gaps, you must provide a detailed explanation.\n\n**2. How to Handle Issues in the Solution**\nWhen you identify an issue in a step, you MUST first classify it into one of the following two categories and then follow the specified procedure.\n\n*   **a. Critical Error:**\n    This is any error that breaks the logical chain of the proof. This includes both **logical fallacies** (e.g., claiming that `A>B, C>D` implies `A-C>B-D`) and **factual errors** (e.g., a calculation error like `2+3=6`).\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the specific error and state that it **invalidates the current line of reasoning**.\n        *   Do NOT check any further steps that rely on this error.\n        *   You MUST, however, scan the rest of the solution to identify and verify any fully independent parts. For example, if a proof is split into multiple cases, an error in one case does not prevent you from checking the other cases.\n\n*   **b. Justification Gap:**\n    This is for steps where the conclusion may be correct, but the provided argument is incomplete, hand-wavy, or lacks sufficient rigor.\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the gap in the justification.\n        *   State that you will **assume the step's conclusion is true** for the sake of argument.\n        *   Then, proceed to verify all subsequent steps to check if the remainder of the argument is sound.\n\n**3. Output Format**\nYour response MUST be structured into two main sections: a **Summary** followed by the **Detailed Verification Log**.\n\n*   **a. Summary**\n    This section MUST be at the very beginning of your response. It must contain two components:\n    *   **Final Verdict**: A single, clear sentence declaring the overall validity of the solution. For example: \"The solution is correct,\" \"The solution contains a Critical Error and is therefore invalid,\" or \"The solution's approach is viable but contains several Justification Gaps.\"\n    *   **List of Findings**: A bulleted list that summarizes **every** issue you discovered. For each finding, you must provide:\n        *   **Location:** A direct quote of the key phrase or equation where the issue occurs.\n        *   **Issue:** A brief description of the problem and its classification (**Critical Error** or **Justification Gap**).\n\n*   **b. Detailed Verification Log**\n    Following the summary, provide the full, step-by-step verification log as defined in the Core Instructions. When you refer to a specific part of the solution, **quote the relevant text** to make your reference clear before providing your detailed analysis of that part.\n\n**Example of the Required Summary Format**\n*This is a generic example to illustrate the required format. Your findings must be based on the actual solution provided below.*\n\n**Final Verdict:** The solution is **invalid** because it contains a Critical Error.\n\n**List of Findings:**\n*   **Location:** \"By interchanging the limit and the integral, we get...\"\n    *   **Issue:** Justification Gap - The solution interchanges a limit and an integral without providing justification, such as proving uniform convergence.\n*   **Location:** \"From $A > B$ and $C > D$, it follows that $A-C > B-D$\"\n    *   **Issue:** Critical Error - This step is a logical fallacy.

"### Summary ###\n\n**Final Verdict:** The solution is correct.\n\n**List of Findings:**\n*   No issues were found in the solution. All steps are logically sound, rigorously justified, and lead to the correct conclusion.\n\n### Detailed Verification Log ###\n\n**1. Initial Setup and Simplification**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"Let the given expression be $E$. ... $E = \\frac{2q^2}{1 + 2 + \\dots + q}$\"\n*   **Verification:** This step correctly defines the expression $E$ as given in the problem statement. This is a standard and correct way to begin.\n\n*   **Solution Text:** \"The denominator is the sum of the first $q$ positive integers. The formula for this arithmetic series is: $1 + 2 + \\dots + q = \\frac{q(q+1)}{2}$\"\n*   **Verification:** This step correctly identifies the denominator as an arithmetic series and applies the standard formula for the sum of the first $q$ positive integers. The formula is correct.\n\n*   **Solution Text:** \"Substituting this formula into the expression for $E$, we obtain: $E = \\frac{2q^2}{\\frac{q(q+1)}{2}}$\"\n*   **Verification:** The substitution is performed correctly.\n\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We can simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator: $E = 2q^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{q(q+1)} = \\frac{4q^2}{q(q+1)}$\"\n*   **Verification:** The algebraic simplification is correct.\n\n*   **Solution Text:** \"Since $q$ is a prime number, we know that $q \\ge 2$, and therefore $q \\neq 0$. This allows us to cancel a factor of $q$ from the numerator and the denominator: $E = \\frac{4q}{q+1}$\"\n*   **Verification:** The reasoning is sound. Since $q$ is a prime number, it cannot be zero, which rigorously justifies the cancellation of the factor $q$. The resulting expression is correct.\n\n**2. Condition for Integer Values**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"The problem is now reduced to finding the number of prime numbers $q$ for which $\\frac{4q}{q+1}$ is an integer. We can perform an algebraic manipulation on the expression for $E$: $E = \\frac{4q}{q+1} = \\frac{4(q+1) - 4}{q+1} = \\frac{4(q+1)}{q+1} - \\frac{4}{q+1} = 4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$\"\n*   **Verification:** This is a standard and effective algebraic manipulation (polynomial long division in disguise) to simplify the condition for $E$ being an integer. The steps are arithmetically correct.\n\n*   **Solution Text:** \"For $E$ to be an integer, the expression $4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$ must be an integer. Since $4$ is an integer, this condition holds if and only if $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ is also an integer.\"\n*   **Verification:** The logic is correct. The difference between two integers is an integer. Therefore, if $E$ is an integer, then $4-E = \\frac{4}{q+1}$ must also be an integer. This is a necessary and sufficient condition.\n\n**3. Finding Possible Values for q**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"For $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ to be an integer, the denominator $q+1$ must be an integer divisor of the numerator $4$. The set of all integer divisors of $4$ is $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$.\"\n*   **Verification:** This step correctly identifies the implication: for a fraction `N/D` to be an integer (where N, D are integers), `D` must be a divisor of `N`. The set of integer divisors of 4 is listed completely and correctly.\n\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We now use the property that $q$ is a prime number. By definition, a prime number is an integer greater than $1$. The smallest prime number is $2$. Thus, we have the constraint $q \\ge 2$. This constraint on $q$ implies a constraint on $q+1$: $q \\ge 2 \\implies q+1 \\ge 3$\"\n*   **Verification:** The reasoning here is flawless. The definition of a prime number is correctly used to establish a lower bound for $q$, which in turn provides a correct lower bound for the expression $q+1$.\n\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We must find which of the integer divisors of $4$ satisfy the condition $q+1 \\ge 3$. Let's check the set of divisors $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$: ... The only value in the set of divisors of $4$ that is greater than or equal to $3$ is $4$.\"\n*   **Verification:** The process of checking each divisor against the derived condition $q+1 \\ge 3$ is executed correctly. The conclusion that $q+1$ must be $4$ is valid.\n\n**4. Final Solution and Verification**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"Therefore, we must have: $q+1 = 4$. Solving for $q$, we find: $q = 3$\"\n*   **Verification:** The equation is solved correctly.\n\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We must verify that this value of $q$ is a prime number. The number $3$ is indeed a prime number. Thus, $q=3$ is the unique prime number that satisfies the condition.\"\n*   **Verification:** This is a crucial verification step. The solution correctly confirms that the value found for $q$ satisfies the initial condition of being a prime number.\n\n*   **Solution Text:** \"To confirm, for $q=3$, the original expression evaluates to: $E = \\frac{2(3^2)}{1+2+3} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 9}{6} = \\frac{18}{6} = 3$. Since $3$ is an integer, the solution is correct.\"\n*   **Verification:** This final check, while not strictly necessary for the proof's logic, is good practice and is performed correctly, confirming the validity of the found solution.\n\n*   **Solution Text:** \"The problem asks for the number of such prime numbers $q$. As we have found only one such prime, the answer is 1.\"\n*   **Verification:** The solution correctly answers the question posed in the problem statement (\"banyaknya bilangan prima q\" - the number of prime numbers q). Since a unique solution was found, the count is 1. This is the correct final answer."

The problem asks for the number of prime numbers $q$ for which $E$ is an integer, where\n$$E = \\frac{2q^2}{1 + 2 + \\dots + q}$$\n\nThe denominator is the sum of the first $q$ positive integers. The formula for this arithmetic series is:\n$$1 + 2 + \\dots + q = \\frac{q(q+1)}{2}$$\n\nSubstituting this formula into the expression for $E$, we obtain:\n$$E = \\frac{2q^2}{\\frac{q(q+1)}{2}}$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$$E = 2q^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{q(q+1)} = \\frac{4q^2}{q(q+1)}$$\n\nSince $q$ is a prime number, we know that $q \\ge 2$, and therefore $q \\neq 0$. This allows us to cancel a factor of $q$ from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$E = \\frac{4q}{q+1}$$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the number of prime numbers $q$ for which $\\frac{4q}{q+1}$ is an integer.

Since $4$ is an integer, this condition holds if and only if $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ is also an integer.\n\nFor $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ to be an integer, the denominator $q+1$ must be an integer divisor of the numerator $4$. The set of all integer divisors of $4$ is $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$.\n\nWe now use the property that $q$ is a prime number. By definition, a prime number is an integer greater than $1$. The smallest prime number is $2$. Thus, we have the constraint $q \\ge 2$.\nThis constraint on $q$ implies a constraint on $q+1$:\n$$q \\ge 2 \\implies q+1 \\ge 3$$\n\nWe must find which of the integer divisors of $4$ satisfy the condition $q+1 \\ge 3$. Let's check the set of divisors $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$:\n*   $-4 < 3$\n*   $-2 < 3$\n*   $-1 < 3$\n*   $1 < 3$\n*   $2 < 3$\n*   $4 \\ge 3$\n\nThe only value in the set of divisors of $4$ that is greater than or equal to $3$ is $4$.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$$q+1 = 4$$\nSolving for $q$, we find:\n$$q = 3$$\n\nWe must verify that this value of $q$ is a prime number. The number $3$ is indeed a prime number. Thus, $q=3$ is the unique prime number that satisfies the condition.\n\nTo confirm, for $q=3$, the original expression evaluates to:\n$$E = \\frac{2(3^2)}{1+2+3} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 9}{6} = \\frac{18}{6} = 3$$\nSince $3$ is an integer, the solution is correct.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of such prime numbers $q$. As we have found only one such prime, the answer is 1.\n\n\n### Verification Task Reminder ###\n\nYour task is to act as an IMO grader.

"### Summary ###\n\n**Final Verdict:** The solution is correct.\n\n**List of Findings:**\n*   No issues were found. The solution is logically sound, and every step is rigorously justified.\n\n### Detailed Verification Log ###\n\n**1. Initial Setup**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"Let the given expression be $E$. The problem asks for the number of prime numbers $q$ for which $E$ is an integer, where $E = \\frac{2q^2}{1 + 2 + \\dots + q}$\"\n*   **Verification:** This step correctly translates the problem statement into a mathematical expression. The setup is clear and accurate.\n\n**2. Denominator Simplification**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"The denominator is the sum of the first $q$ positive integers. The formula for this arithmetic series is: $1 + 2 + \\dots + q = \\frac{q(q+1)}{2}$\"\n*   **Verification:** This step correctly identifies the denominator as the sum of the first $q$ integers and applies the standard formula for an arithmetic series. The formula is correct.\n\n**3. Expression Simplification**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"Substituting this formula into the expression for $E$, we obtain: $E = \\frac{2q^2}{\\frac{q(q+1)}{2}}$ We can simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator: $E = 2q^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{q(q+1)} = \\frac{4q^2}{q(q+1)}$\"\n*   **Verification:** The substitution and subsequent algebraic simplification are performed correctly.\n\n**4. Cancelling a Factor**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"Since $q$ is a prime number, we know that $q \\ge 2$, and therefore $q \\neq 0$. This allows us to cancel a factor of $q$ from the numerator and the denominator: $E = \\frac{4q}{q+1}$\"\n*   **Verification:** The step correctly cancels a factor of $q$. The justification that $q \\neq 0$ because $q$ is a prime number is sound and necessary for this step to be valid.\n\n**5. Algebraic Manipulation**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We can perform an algebraic manipulation on the expression for $E$: $E = \\frac{4q}{q+1} = \\frac{4(q+1) - 4}{q+1} = \\frac{4(q+1)}{q+1} - \\frac{4}{q+1} = 4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$\"\n*   **Verification:** This is a standard and correct algebraic manipulation, equivalent to polynomial long division. It effectively isolates the fractional part of the expression, which is the key to solving the problem.\n\n**6. Condition for Integrality**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"For $E$ to be an integer, the expression $4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$ must be an integer. Since $4$ is an integer, this condition holds if and only if $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ is also an integer.\"\n*   **Verification:** The logic is correct. The difference of two integers is an integer. Since $E$ must be an integer and $4$ is an integer, their difference, $4-E = \\frac{4}{q+1}$, must also be an integer.\n\n**7. Identifying Divisors**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"For $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ to be an integer, the denominator $q+1$ must be an integer divisor of the numerator $4$. The set of all integer divisors of $4$ is $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$.\"\n*   **Verification:** This step correctly deduces that $q+1$ must be a divisor of 4 and correctly lists all integer divisors of 4.\n\n**8. Applying Constraints on q**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We now use the property that $q$ is a prime number. By definition, a prime number is an integer greater than $1$. The smallest prime number is $2$. Thus, we have the constraint $q \\ge 2$. This constraint on $q$ implies a constraint on $q+1$: $q \\ge 2 \\implies q+1 \\ge 3$\"\n*   **Verification:** The reasoning is sound. The definition of a prime number is correctly used to establish a lower bound for $q$, which in turn provides a necessary condition for $q+1$.\n\n**9. Filtering Possible Values**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We must find which of the integer divisors of $4$ satisfy the condition $q+1 \\ge 3$. Let's check the set of divisors $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$: ... The only value in the set of divisors of $4$ that is greater than or equal to $3$ is $4$.\"\n*   **Verification:** The check is performed systematically and correctly. The conclusion that $q+1$ must be $4$ is valid.\n\n**10. Solving for q**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"Therefore, we must have: $q+1 = 4$. Solving for $q$, we find: $q = 3$\"\n*   **Verification:** The calculation is correct.\n\n**11. Final Verification of q**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We must verify that this value of $q$ is a prime number. The number $3$ is indeed a prime number. Thus, $q=3$ is the unique prime number that satisfies the condition.\"\n*   **Verification:** This is a crucial final check. The solution correctly verifies that the value found for $q$ meets the initial condition of being a prime number.\n\n**12. Conclusion**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"To confirm, for $q=3$, the original expression evaluates to: $E = \\frac{2(3^2)}{1+2+3} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 9}{6} = \\frac{18}{6} = 3$. Since $3$ is an integer, the solution is correct. The problem asks for the number of such prime numbers $q$. As we have found only one such prime, the answer is 1.\"\n*   **Verification:** The optional check by substituting $q=3$ into the original expression is performed correctly. The final answer correctly states the number of solutions found, which is what the problem asked for. The conclusion is fully supported by the preceding steps."

Thus, we have the constraint $q \\ge 2$.\n    > This constraint on $q$ implies a constraint on $q+1$:\n    > $$q \\ge 2 \\implies q+1 \\ge 3$$\n*   **Verification:**\n    *   The definition of a prime number is correctly used to establish the lower bound $q \\ge 2$.\n    *   The implication $q \\ge 2 \\implies q+1 \\ge 3$ is a correct and crucial deduction. This step is correct.\n\n**8. Finding the Unique Solution for q+1**\n*   **Solution Text:**\n    > We must find which of the integer divisors of $4$ satisfy the condition $q+1 \\ge 3$. Let's check the set of divisors $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$:\n    > *   $-4 < 3$\n    > *   $-2 < 3$\n    > *   $-1 < 3$\n    > *   $1 < 3$\n    > *   $2 < 3$\n    > *   $4 \\ge 3$\n    > The only value in the set of divisors of $4$ that is greater than or equal to $3$ is $4$.\n*   **Verification:**\n    *   The process of filtering the set of divisors using the derived condition $q+1 \\ge 3$ is logical and executed correctly.\n    *   The conclusion that $q+1$ must be $4$ is correct. This step is correct.\n\n**9. Solving for q and Final Verification**\n*   **Solution Text:**\n    > Therefore, we must have:\n    > $$q+1 = 4$$\n    > Solving for $q$, we find:\n    > $$q = 3$$\n    > We must verify that this value of $q$ is a prime number. The number $3$ is indeed a prime number. Thus, $q=3$ is the unique prime number that satisfies the condition.\n*   **Verification:**\n    *   Solving $q+1=4$ gives $q=3$, which is correct.\n    *   The solution correctly performs the necessary check to ensure the found value of $q$ adheres to the problem's constraint of being a prime number. The number 3 is prime. This step is correct.\n\n**10. Conclusion**\n*   **Solution Text:**\n    > To confirm, for $q=3$, the original expression evaluates to:\n    > $$E = \\frac{2(3^2)}{1+2+3} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 9}{6} = \\frac{18}{6} = 3$$\n    > Since $3$ is an integer, the solution is correct.\n    > The problem asks for the number of such prime numbers $q$. As we have found only one such prime, the answer is 1.\n*   **Verification:**\n    *   The optional check by substituting $q=3$ back into the original expression is a good practice and is calculated correctly.\n    *   The argument has exhaustively considered all possibilities and found a single valid solution. The final answer, that there is only 1 such prime number, is correct. This step is correct."

"### Summary ###\n\n**Final Verdict:** The solution is correct.\n\n**List of Findings:**\n*   No issues were found in the provided solution. The argument is logically sound, and every step is rigorously justified.\n\n### Detailed Verification Log ###\n\n**1. Initial Setup**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"Let the given expression be $E$. The problem asks for the number of prime numbers $q$ for which $E$ is an integer, where $E = \\frac{2q^2}{1 + 2 + \\dots + q}$\"\n*   **Verification:** This step correctly translates the problem statement into a mathematical expression. The setup is clear and accurate.\n\n**2. Denominator Simplification**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"The denominator is the sum of the first $q$ positive integers. The formula for this arithmetic series is: $1 + 2 + \\dots + q = \\frac{q(q+1)}{2}$\"\n*   **Verification:** The solution correctly identifies the denominator as the sum of an arithmetic series and applies the standard, correct formula.\n\n**3. Expression Substitution**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"Substituting this formula into the expression for $E$, we obtain: $E = \\frac{2q^2}{\\frac{q(q+1)}{2}}$\"\n*   **Verification:** The substitution of the simplified denominator into the expression for $E$ is performed correctly.\n\n**4. Algebraic Simplification (Part 1)**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We can simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator: $E = 2q^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{q(q+1)} = \\frac{4q^2}{q(q+1)}$\"\n*   **Verification:** The algebraic simplification of the complex fraction is correct.\n\n**5. Algebraic Simplification (Part 2)**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"Since $q$ is a prime number, we know that $q \\ge 2$, and therefore $q \\neq 0$. This allows us to cancel a factor of $q$ from the numerator and the denominator: $E = \\frac{4q}{q+1}$\"\n*   **Verification:** The cancellation of the factor $q$ is valid. The justification provided (that $q$ is prime and thus non-zero) is correct and necessary for this step to be rigorous.\n\n**6. Algebraic Manipulation**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We can perform an algebraic manipulation on the expression for $E$: $E = \\frac{4q}{q+1} = \\frac{4(q+1) - 4}{q+1} = \\frac{4(q+1)}{q+1} - \\frac{4}{q+1} = 4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$\"\n*   **Verification:** This is a standard and effective algebraic manipulation (similar to polynomial long division) to isolate the variable $q$. The calculation is performed correctly.\n\n**7. Condition for Integer Value**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"For $E$ to be an integer, the expression $4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$ must be an integer. Since $4$ is an integer, this condition holds if and only if $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ is also an integer.\"\n*   **Verification:** The reasoning is sound. The difference of two numbers is an integer if and only if either both are integers or their fractional parts sum to an integer. Since one number (4) is an integer, the other term ($\\frac{4}{q+1}$) must also be an integer.\n\n**8. Divisibility Condition**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"For $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ to be an integer, the denominator $q+1$ must be an integer divisor of the numerator $4$. The set of all integer divisors of $4$ is $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$.\"\n*   **Verification:** This step correctly translates the condition from the previous step into a statement about divisibility. The list of integer divisors of 4 is complete and correct.\n\n**9. Applying Constraints on q**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We now use the property that $q$ is a prime number. By definition, a prime number is an integer greater than $1$. The smallest prime number is $2$. Thus, we have the constraint $q \\ge 2$. This constraint on $q$ implies a constraint on $q+1$: $q \\ge 2 \\implies q+1 \\ge 3$\"\n*   **Verification:** The solution correctly uses the definition of a prime number to establish a lower bound for $q$. The subsequent derivation of the lower bound for $q+1$ is also correct. This is a crucial step in narrowing down the possibilities.\n\n**10. Filtering Possible Values**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We must find which of the integer divisors of $4$ satisfy the condition $q+1 \\ge 3$. Let's check the set of divisors $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$: ... The only value in the set of divisors of $4$ that is greater than or equal to $3$ is $4$.\"\n*   **Verification:** The solution correctly applies the derived constraint $q+1 \\ge 3$ to the set of possible values for $q+1$. The filtering process is accurate, correctly identifying $4$ as the only valid possibility.\n\n**11. Solving for q**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"Therefore, we must have: $q+1 = 4$. Solving for $q$, we find: $q = 3$\"\n*   **Verification:** The equation is solved correctly.\n\n**12. Final Verification of q**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"We must verify that this value of $q$ is a prime number. The number $3$ is indeed a prime number. Thus, $q=3$ is the unique prime number that satisfies the condition.\"\n*   **Verification:** This is a necessary check. The solution correctly confirms that the value found for $q$ satisfies the initial condition of being a prime number.\n\n**13. Final Answer**\n*   **Solution Text:** \"The problem asks for the number of such prime numbers $q$. As we have found only one such prime, the answer is 1.\"\n*   **Verification:** The solution correctly answers the question asked in the problem (\"banyaknya\" means \"the number of\"). Since only one prime was found, the count is 1. The optional check by substituting $q=3$ into the original expression is also performed correctly and confirms the result."

Substitution and Algebraic Simplification**\n> Substituting this formula into the expression for $E$, we obtain:\n> $$E = \\frac{2q^2}{\\frac{q(q+1)}{2}}$$\n> We can simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n> $$E = 2q^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{q(q+1)} = \\frac{4q^2}{q(q+1)}$$\n\n*   **Analysis:** The substitution is performed correctly. The subsequent algebraic simplification is also correct.\n\n**4. Cancellation of a Factor**\n> Since $q$ is a prime number, we know that $q \\ge 2$, and therefore $q \\neq 0$. This allows us to cancel a factor of $q$ from the numerator and the denominator:\n> $$E = \\frac{4q}{q+1}$$\n\n*   **Analysis:** The solution correctly notes that since $q$ is a prime number, $q \\neq 0$, which rigorously justifies the cancellation of the factor $q$. The resulting expression is correct.\n\n**5. Algebraic Manipulation for Integer Condition Analysis**\n> We can perform an algebraic manipulation on the expression for $E$:\n> $$E = \\frac{4q}{q+1} = \\frac{4(q+1) - 4}{q+1} = \\frac{4(q+1)}{q+1} - \\frac{4}{q+1} = 4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$$\n\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard and effective technique for analyzing the integer properties of a rational expression. The algebraic manipulation is performed flawlessly. This step is correct.\n\n**6. Establishing the Integer Condition**\n> For $E$ to be an integer, the expression $4 - \\frac{4}{q+1}$ must be an integer. Since $4$ is an integer, this condition holds if and only if $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ is also an integer.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The logic is sound. The difference of two integers is an integer. Therefore, if $E$ and $4$ are integers, $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ must also be an integer. This step is correct.\n\n**7. Divisibility Requirement**\n> For $\\frac{4}{q+1}$ to be an integer, the denominator $q+1$ must be an integer divisor of the numerator $4$. The set of all integer divisors of $4$ is $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The solution correctly deduces that $q+1$ must be a divisor of 4. The list of integer divisors of 4 is complete and correct.\n\n**8. Applying the Prime Constraint**\n> We now use the property that $q$ is a prime number. By definition, a prime number is an integer greater than $1$. The smallest prime number is $2$. Thus, we have the constraint $q \\ge 2$.\n> This constraint on $q$ implies a constraint on $q+1$:\n> $$q \\ge 2 \\implies q+1 \\ge 3$$\n\n*   **Analysis:** The solution correctly uses the definition of a prime number to establish a lower bound for $q$, and consequently for $q+1$. This is a crucial step and is executed correctly.\n\n**9. Filtering the Possible Values**\n> We must find which of the integer divisors of $4$ satisfy the condition $q+1 \\ge 3$. Let's check the set of divisors $\\{-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4\\}$:\n> *   ...\n> The only value in the set of divisors of $4$ that is greater than or equal to $3$ is $4$.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The solution systematically checks each divisor against the derived condition $q+1 \\ge 3$. The conclusion that $4$ is the only valid possibility is correct.\n\n**10. Solving for q**\n> Therefore, we must have:\n> $$q+1 = 4$$\n> Solving for $q$, we find:\n> $$q = 3$$\n\n*   **Analysis:** The equation is solved correctly.\n\n**11. Final Verification and Conclusion**\n> We must verify that this value of $q$ is a prime number. The number $3$ is indeed a prime number. Thus, $q=3$ is the unique prime number that satisfies the condition.\n> ...\n> The problem asks for the number of such prime numbers $q$. As we have found only one such prime, the answer is 1.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The solution correctly verifies that the found value of $q$ satisfies the initial condition of being a prime number. The optional check by substituting $q=3$ into the original expression confirms the result. The final answer correctly states the number of solutions found. This step is correct."
